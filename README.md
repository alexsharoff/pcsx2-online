PCSX2 Online
============

PCSX2 Online is a fork of open-source PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2 with peer-to-peer netplay mode.

You can find the latest version here http://www.mediafire.com/?r3c1ejv5m85ekrv

This repository is a read-only archive.

Fusion of current pcsx2 and pcsx2-online with some modifications / improvements: https://github.com/SmileTheory/pcsx2

Changes from this repository are available as a proper fork here: https://github.com/alexsharoff/pcsx2 (branch 'netplay'). It should be buildable with VS 2010 right after git clone. I've also created a list of all issues I remember there.

How to start netplay
--------------------

System -> Boot Netplay. The connection dialog is pretty self-explanatory.

What you should know before playing
-----------------------------------

* To avoid desyncs do not change any settings except for the controller plugin configuration. It's not like it will definitely desync if you change anything, but the possibility escalates.

* During netplay, emulation settings are temporarily reset to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. And by 'emulation settings' I mean Config->Emulation Settings dialog, so plugin settings remain intact.

Features
--------

* Peer-to-peer network connection, no centralized servers needed
* Automatic input delay detection

(Official) Working games list
-------------------------------

* Melty Blood Actress Again
* Tekken 5
* Capcom vs SNK 2
* Guilty Gear XX Accent Core
* Hokuto no Ken
* King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match
* Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3

Working with frequent desyncs
-----------------------------

* Fate/Unlimited Codes
* King of Fighters XI
