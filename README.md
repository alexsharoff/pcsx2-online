Disclaimer
--------------------

At the time, this project was conceived as a proof-of-concept and a fun challenge. I don't have as much free time now, nor do I have any incentive to go on with this project.

I wanted to play Melty Blood online, so I hacked PCSX2 just for that. Since then we've got an official PC port with much better netplay (even though I haven't been playing Melty much lately), so I can't find any reason to force myself to go on with this project.

If anyone wants to continue with this project I'm more than happy to share my knowledge.

How to start netplay
--------------------

System -> Boot Netplay. The connection dialog is pretty self-explanatory.

What you should know before playing
-----------------------------------

* To avoid desyncs do not change any settings except for the controller plugin configuration. It's not like it will definitely desync if you change anything, but the possibility escalates.

* During netplay, emulation settings are temporarily reset to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. And by 'emulation settings' I mean Config->Emulation Settings dialog, so plugin settings remain intact.

Features
--------

* Peer-to-peer network connection, no centralized servers needed
* Automatic input delay detection

(Official) Working games list
-------------------------------

* Melty Blood Actress Again
* Tekken 5
* Capcom vs SNK 2
* Guilty Gear XX Accent Core
* Hokuto no Ken
* King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match
* Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3

Working with frequent desyncs
-----------------------------

* Fate/Unlimited Codes
* King of Fighters XI
